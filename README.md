# Quizler: Your Ultimate Study Companion!

Welcome to Quizler, a powerful web application designed to revolutionize your study sessions. Built using Spring Boot, JWT, Angular, and Google Auth, Quizler offers a suite of features that cater to students or anyone preparing for exams or learning new topics.

## Features
### 1. Intelligent Quiz Generation
Quizler's core function leverages generative AI to create short quizzes from your study materials or chosen topics. _**Here's how it works:**_

#### Upload Study Materials: Upload your notes, and Quizler will parse the text and data.
- **Edit & Generate:** Edit the parsed content before sending it to a Generative AI API to create a quiz.
- **Answer & Score:** Take the quiz, submit your answers, and receive an instant score.
- **Review & Retry:** All quizzes and scores are stored in a database, allowing you to review past attempts and retry quizzes to track your progress and improve.
- Additionally, you can generate quizzes by entering a _topic name_, and Quizler will create relevant questions for you.

### 2. Calendar Scheduling Tool
Organize your study sessions and consultations with the built-in calendar scheduling tool:

- **Schedule Events:** Input the study/consultation date, time, and attendees' emails.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** The app uses Google OAuth to schedule events directly in your Google Calendar.
- **Email Invitations:** Automatically sends email invitations to all attendees, allowing them to accept the calendar invite seamlessly.

- **Study with Friends:** Host study sessions with your friends through video calls.
- **Consult with Professors:** Use the video call feature for one-on-one consultations with your professors.
